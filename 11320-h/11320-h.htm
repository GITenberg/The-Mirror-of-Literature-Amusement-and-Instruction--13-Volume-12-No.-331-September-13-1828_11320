<h2>CHARLECOTE HALL, NEAR STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</h2>
<div class="figure" style="width:100%;"><a href=

<p>"One of the most delightful things in the world is going a
journey." Now if there be one of our million of friends who, like
the fop in the play, thinks all beyond Hyde Park a desert, let him
forthwith proceed on a pilgrimage to <i>Stratford-upon-Avon</i>,
the birthplace of SHAKSPEARE; and though he be the veriest Londoner
that ever sung of the "sweet shady side of Pall Mall," we venture
to predict his reform. If such be not the result, then we envy him
not a jot of his terrestrial enjoyment. Let him but think of the
countless hours of delight, the "full houses," the lighted dome and
deeping circles, of the past season; when</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dread o'er the scene the ghost of Hamlet stalks;</p>
<p>Othello rages, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and then will he not enjoy a visit to the place where&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;&mdash;Sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy's child,</p>
<p>Warbled his native wood-notes wild.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sterne, the prince of sentimental tourists, says, "Let me have a
companion of my way, were it but to remark how the shadows lengthen
as the sun declines;" but, for our part, we should prefer a visit
to Stratford, <i>alone</i>, unless it were with some garrulous old
guide to entertain us with his or her reminiscences.</p>
<p>This brings us to <i>Charlecote Hall</i>, one of the
Shakspearean relics. It consists of a venerable mansion, situated
on the banks of the Avon, about four miles from Stratford, and
built in the first year of the reign of Elizabeth, by Sir Thomas
Lucy;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A parliamente member, and justice of peace.</p>
<p>At home a poor scare-crow, at London an asse,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and so well known as the prosecutor of Shakspeare. <a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The principal front, here represented, assumes, in its ground
plan, the form of the letter E&mdash;said to have been intended as
a compliment to the queen, who, as appears from the Black Book of
Warwick, visited this place in 1572.</p>
<p>The above is copied from one of a Series of Views illustrative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>[pg
162]</span> of the Life of Shakspeare, drawn and etched by Mr. W.
Rider, of Leamington. These engravings are five in number, but the
artist explains that he has selected such subjects only, "as from
tradition, or more certain record, might fairly be presumed to bear
direct relation to the life of the poet. But while he regrets that
the number of authenticated subjects are so few, he feels that from
innovation or decay, they are almost hourly becoming fewer; and is,
therefore, prompted to secure the few remnants left, while they are
yet within his reach."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the grounds around Charlecote Hall, were
the early haunts of SHAKSPEARE; and that in the house itself sat
the magisterial authority, before which he was doomed to meet the
charges, to which his youthful indiscretions had rendered him
liable; and, as it remains, to the present time, for the most part,
unaltered, and <i>presents to the spectator of the present day the
same image that was often, and under such peculiar circumstances,
impressed on the eye of our</i> SHAKSPEARE, it cannot but be
regarded with the most intense interest by all his admirers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would recommend the illustrators of Shakspeare
to possess themselves of a set of Mr. Rider's "Views;" whilst the
visiter of Stratford-upon-Avon would do well to lay a copy in his
portmanteau&mdash;for they are in truth so many faithful memorials
of the great poet of nature.</p>

<h2>ON NATIONAL VARIETIES.</h2>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>There are few more familiar subjects than that of the varieties
of national character, and the resemblances and differences that
exist between ourselves and the inhabitants of other countries. Few
conversations occur upon circumstances which may have happened
abroad, in which some one has not an anecdote to relate to
illustrate the known peculiarities of the nation in question; and
the greater part of the travels and tours which now issue in such
formidable numbers from the press, are naturally filled with
stories and incidents, either to show the correctness of our ideas
of the manners and opinions of our neighbours, or (perhaps more
frequently) to prove that the public were in error in that respect,
up to the time when the traveller in question had discovered the
truth, or a clue to it. The daily accounts of the outrages
perpetrated in Ireland, and the alarms that are sounded ever and
anon, touching the state of that unhappy country, are continually
exciting surprise, that the natives of the sister island should be
so unaccountably deficient in that sense of order and sobriety
which prevails in Great Britain. We associate with a Scotchman the
ideas of shrewdness and prudence; with a Frenchman, gaiety and
frivolity; with a Spaniard, gravity and pride; with an Italian,
strong passions of love and revenge: with a German, plodding
industry and habits of deep thinking; and with the northern
nations, an honest sincerity and persevering courage. We sometimes
judge with tolerable correctness; at others are wholly mistaken,
and not unfrequently run into such extremes, that having
established a principle, that a particular people are knavish, or
cowardly, or stupid, we are unwilling to admit any exceptions, but
include the whole race in our sweeping censure. We are prejudiced
at first sight against a Portuguese or Italian, and are careful of
our communications with him, even though we meet him on the high
road, or by mere accident in a public place. There can, however, be
no mistake in the common notion, that each nation has a peculiar
collection of qualities and habits, distinguishing it in a greater
or less degree from its neighbours, and the rest of the world; and
it is, therefore, at all events, an interesting, if not an useful
topic, to reflect a little how these differences arise. Not that we
intend here to give even any particular description of the various
races of mankind, or to enter into any inquiry upon the degrees of
their mental and bodily capacities; such would be foreign to our
purpose, and would exceed our limits. We shall merely hazard a few
observations upon the several causes to which the diversities in
men have been referred, not pretending to any decided opinion on so
nice a point, as whether these causes are wholly of a physical or
of a moral kind, or whether they are compounded of both. The
question is, perhaps, one of the most difficult in the whole range
of philosophical experience; we say experience, because it is
obvious that all theory on the subject must be the result of
observation and analysis; and that no general principles can be
laid down in the first instance, as the ground work of any
hypothesis we might be inclined to frame.</p>
<p>The scientific men to whom we are chiefly indebted for the facts
accumulated on this subject, are Dr. Blumenbach, of G&ouml;ttingen,
Dr. Pritchard, of Edinburgh, and the eminent surgeon, Mr. Lawrence.
It has been a favourite matter of speculation with Lord Monboddo,
as well as with Voltaire, Rousseau, and the philosophers of the
French school, who have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name=
"page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> endeavoured to show that men and
other animals are endowed with reason or instinct of the same kind,
but of different degrees. According to these fanciful writers, the
monkey is but another species of the human race, and has been
termed by them <i>Homo Sylvestris</i>. They made the most diligent
researches into all accounts concerning men in a savage state, and
were delighted beyond measure with the discovery alleged to have
been made in the island of Sumatra, of men with tails regularly
protruding from their hinder parts, who, according to Buffon,
walked and talked in the woods like other gentlemen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And backwards and forwards they switched their long tails,</p>
<p>Like a gentleman switching his cane.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The appearance of Peter the Wild Boy, who was found in the woods
of Hamela, in Hanover, living on the bark of trees, leaves,
berries, &amp;c. threw Voltaire into transports of joy. He declared
the event to be the most wonderful and important that ages had
recorded in the annals of science, as it demonstrated the fact of
man living after the fashion of beasts, without the least spark of
civilization, and without speech; thereby forming a species of a
nature having more in common with monkeys than with men, and
presenting the regular degree, or intermediate class, between the
<i>homo civilis</i> and the <i>homo sylvestris</i>. The
circumstance, however, which afterwards transpired, of Peter's
having been found with the remains of a shirt-collar about his
neck, threw considerable discredit on the whole story; and the
young savage, on being brought to England by order of Queen
Caroline, lived in Hertfordshire for many years, perfectly harmless
and tractable, and behaving pretty much the same as other idiots.
The idea, therefore, of a race of men, in a healthy, natural
condition, having ever existed without the possession of reason, is
now deemed wholly fallacious. It is even maintained by Schlegel,
and other authorities of great weight, that the civilized state is
the primitive one, and that savage life is a degeneracy from it,
rather than civilized society being a graft upon barbarity. By
Schlegel's theory, the East, especially India, was the earliest
seat of arts and sciences; from the Sanscrit, or Indian language,
now extinct, are the Hebrew, the Chaldaic, the Greek, and many
others of the most ancient tongues, derived; and from the wisdom
and learning of the East "was the whole earth overspread."
Undoubtedly it is difficult to imagine by what gradation language
could have proceeded, from the howl of savages, and the cries of
nature, till it reached the eloquent music, the heart-stirring
oratory of the Greek; and besides this, and other considerations,
Schlegel is supported by the opinions of Adelung, the learned
author of "Mithridates, oder Allgemeine Sprachenkunde," upon the
probable habitation of the first family of the human race. Adelung
says, that civilization began in Asia, as is, indeed, universally
admitted to have been the case; and that when the waters of the
flood subsided, the highest ground, we may naturally conclude, must
have been the earliest inhabited. We may also reasonably presume
that a beneficent Providence would place the first family in a
situation where their wants could be easily satisfied; in a garden,
as it were, stocked with all herbs and fruits, fit and agreeable to
their use and taste. Now such a country is actually to be found in
Central Asia, between the degrees of 30 and 50 North lat. and 90
and 110 long. E. of Ferro; a spot as high as the Plains of Quito,
or 9,500 feet above the level of the sea. It contains the sources
of most of the great rivers of Asia; the Seleuga, the Ob, the Lena,
the Irtisch, and the Jenisey flow from hence to the North; the
Jaik, the Jihon, and the Jemba to the West; the Amur and the Hoang
Ho to the East; and the Indus, Ganges, and Burrampooter to the
South. The valleys within this space, which our readers, by
referring to a map, will find to be correctly delineated, abound
with nutritive fruits and vegetables, and with all animals capable
of being tamed. There is evidently, therefore, some plausibility in
the notion that mankind sprung originally from the East, and that
from that quarter civilization is derived; but what portion of
knowledge was allotted to the primitive people, or how far their
descendants have surpassed or fallen short of these olden times,
must, we fear, be for ever beyond the reach of our
investigation.</p>
<p>If we call to mind a summary of the general divisions of human
beings throughout the world, we shall find little room to doubt of
the identity of their genus, and shall, without much trouble of
reflection, class them as different species of that
genus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Facies non omnibus una,</p>
<p>Nec diversa, tamen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Such seems to be the result of Mr. Lawrence's judgment; and
though we are aware that the descent of mankind from one common
stock has been much questioned and controverted, particularly in
Germany, we prefer resting upon the received opinion at present, to
running the risk of shocking established notions, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> by
entering into the merits of the contrary theory.</p>
<p>Men are classed by Dr. Blumenbach under five great divisions,
viz. the Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, and Malay. The
Caucasian family may be asserted, though by its own members, to
have been always pre-eminent above the rest in moral feelings and
intellectual powers, and is remarkable for the large size of their
heads. It need not be more minutely described, than by saying it
includes all the ancient and modern Europeans, (except the
Laplanders and Fins;) the former and present inhabitants of Western
Asia as far as the Ob, the Caspian Sea, and the Ganges, viz. the
Assyrians, Medes, Chaldeans, Sarmatians, Scythians, Parthians,
Philistines, Phoenicians, Jews, and Syrians; the Tartars on the
Caucasus, Georgians, Circassians, Mingrelians, Armenians, Turks,
Persians, Arabs, Hindoos of high caste, Northern Africans,
Egyptians, Abyssinians, and Guanches. They are supposed to have
originally had brown hair and dark eyes.</p>
<p>The Mongolian family is of an olive colour and black eyes, flat
nose and face, small stature, black hair, no beard, and thick lips.
It comprises the people of Central and Northern Asia, Thibet, Ava,
Pegu, Cambodia, Laos, and Siam; the Chinese, Japanese, Fins, and
Esquimaux.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian family is black, with black and woolly hair,
compressed skull, low forehead, flat nose, and thick lips. It
includes all Africans not comprehended in the Caucasian family.</p>
<p>The American family has a dark skin, a red tint, straight hair,
a small beard, low forehead, and broad face. It includes all the
American tribes, except the Esquimaux.</p>
<p>The Malay family is brown, varying from a light tint to black.
Their hair is black and curled, head narrow, bones of the face
prominent, nose broad, and mouth large. They inhabit Malacca,
Sumatra, Java, and the adjacent islands; Molucca, the Ladrones, New
Holland, Van Dieman's Land, New Guinea, New Zealand, and the South
Sea Islands. They speak generally the Malay language.</p>
<p>The difference of character and disposition of these five
families is familiar to every one; they are as well known as is the
superiority of the Caucasian to the other races, and as the outward
distinctions of their bodies and complexions. The reasons of this
difference have been variously assigned, some ascribing it to
natural, others altogether to moral causes. By natural causes we
understand either that the constitutions of the races are such,
that their capabilities of informing their minds, and raising their
intellectual powers, are essentially not the same; or that the
climate has an influence over both their bodies and minds. By moral
causes, we mean artificial or accidental ones arising out of the
state of society; such as the nature of the government, the plenty
or poverty in which people live, a period of war or peace, the
power of public opinion, and such circumstances.</p>
<p>The effect of climate cannot of itself be sufficient to change
the manners and habits of a people. The instances of migratory
nations seem to show this; the Jews are as cunning and fond of
money in Asia or Africa as they are in Poland or England; that
extraordinary race, the Gipsies, (which are now ascertained to be a
Hindoo tribe, driven from their country in the fifteenth century,)
are not less thievish in Transylvania than in Scotland. The
Armenians of Constantinople, and other parts of the Levant, are
represented to be of the same mild and persevering temper, of the
same honesty and skilfulness in their dealings, and the same
kindness and civility of manners, as before they were driven from
their country by Sha-Abbas the Great. The changes, however, in the
habits and character of this people seem to mark the influence of
their several domestic situations. They were originally the most
warlike of the Asiatic tribes; after their subjection by the
Persians, they engaged themselves entirely in the patient
cultivation of the soil; and since the period of the depopulation
of Armenia, and their migrations into Persia, Russia, Turkey, and
other countries, they have been celebrated for their industry in
commercial concerns. They are bankers, money-brokers, merchants,
surgeons, bakers, builders, chintz-printers, and of all trades that
can be imagined, and are represented as the most useful subjects in
the Ottoman empire, retaining at the same time an almost
patriarchal simplicity in their domestic manners. The English in
the East and West Indies, in New South Wales, and in Canada, seldom
lose a relish for the habits and enjoyments they have been bred up
in, whether they migrate to the extremes of heat or of cold. John
Bull is an Englishman in heart, and will remain so under whatever
sun his lot of life may be cast; for,</p>
<blockquote>Coelum, non animum, mutant, qui trans mare
currunt.</blockquote>
<p>We rarely find the Spaniards or Italians, or the natives of the
South of Europe, lose their ideality of character and their warm
passions when settled permanently in England; the only alteration
in them seems to be such as the forms of society <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> and
intercourse with others has led them to. Still the man is the same,
though he may have adopted a new regime in the fashion of his
clothes, or the dishes of his dinner.</p>

<h3>FAIR ROSAMOND.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>In a late Number of the MIRROR, in which you have given a view
of the Labyrinth at Woodstock, and several particulars respecting
Fair Rosamond, many doubts are stated relative to her death, viz.
<i>how</i> and what time. I therefore send you the following
account from <i>Collins's Peerage of England:</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>"Rosamond de Clifford was the eldest of the two daughters of
Walter de Clifford, by Margaret his wife, daughter and heir of
Ralph de Toeny, Lord of Clifford Castle, in Herefordshire, (and had
with her the said castle and lands about it as an inheritance.)
This Rosamond was the unfortunate concubine of Henry II., for whom
the king built that famous Labyrinth<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> at
Woodstock, where she lived so retired, as not easily to be found by
his jealous queen. The king gave her a cabinet of such elegant
workmanship,<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> as showed the fighting of champions,
moving of cattle, flying of birds, and swimming of fish, which were
so artfully represented, as if they had been alive. <i>She died
23rd Henry II. anno 1176</i>, by poison (as was suspected) given
her by Queen Eleanor, and was buried in the Chapter-house of the
Nunnery of Godstow."</p>
<h4>G.F.</h4>
<hr />
<h3>GODSTOW NUNNERY.</h3>
<p>On the banks of the Isis, about two miles from Oxford, are the
remains of Godstow Nunnery. It was founded towards the end of the
reign of Henry I. by Editha, a lady of Winchester, and when
dissolved in the reign of Henry VIII. it was valued at &pound;274.
per annum. A considerable portion of its buildings remained until
the end of the reign of Charles I. about which time they were
accidentally destroyed by fire. The present remains consist chiefly
of ranges of walls on the north, south, and east sides of an
extended area. Near the western extremity of the high north wall
are the remains of two buttresses. There is a small building which
abuts on the east, and ranges along the southern side, which was
probably the Chapter House of the Nuns. The walls are entire, the
roof is of wood, and some of the rafter work is in fair
preservation. It is in this building that the remains of Rosamond
are supposed to have been deposited, when they were removed from
the choir of the church, by the order of Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln,
in 1191. On the north wall is painted a pretended copy of her
epitaph in Latin. Many stone coffins have at various times been
found on this spot.</p>
<h4>HALBERT H.</h4>
<hr />
<h3>SCRAPS FROM TURKISH HISTORY.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p><i>First Landing of the Turks in Europe.</i>&mdash;Orchanes,
second king of the Turks, having settled his monarchy in Lesser
Asia, was determined to get footing in Europe. Solyman, his eldest
son, being willing to undertake the enterprise, was accordingly
despatched with an army of veterans, who crossed the Hellespont,
and arrived on the European side. They soon afterwards seized many
considerable castles and cities belonging to the Greeks, who
offered little or no resistance to the invaders of their empire.
These occurrences transpired about the year 1358.</p>
<p><i>A Woman's Revenge.</i>&mdash;Mahomet the Great, on being
proclaimed Sultan, caused his two innocent brothers to be put to
death; the mother of the youngest immediately afterwards went to
the new king, and reproached him severely for his cruelty. In order
to appease her, he said, "that it consisted with the policy of his
state to do as he had done, but that whatever she asked of him
should be granted her." The lady, therefore, determining to be
revenged, demanded one of the sultan's chief bassas to be delivered
to her. Mahomet, to keep his word, gave orders that it should be
done without delay; and the enraged lady, seeing the bassa bound
before her, first stabbed him, and then plucked out his liver,
which she cast to the dogs.</p>
<p><i>Turkish Superstition.</i>&mdash;Scanderbeg, prince of Epyrus,
after many glorious victories, died on the 17th of January, 1466,
in the 53rd year of his age, and 24th of his reign. He was buried
with great solemnity in the cathedral at Lyssa. The Turks, nine
years afterwards, took the city, and dug up his bones for the
purpose of setting them in rings and bracelets, thinking, by this
means, that they should partake of his invincible fortune.</p>
<p><i>Amurath's Dream.</i>&mdash;About the year 1594, Amurath III.
dreamed that he saw a man of prodigious stature, with one foot
raised upon the Tower of Constantinople, while the other reached
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>[pg
166]</span> over the Bosphorus, and rested on the Asiatic shore. In
one hand, the figure sustained the sun, while the other held the
moon. He struck his foot against the Tower of Constantinople, the
fall of which overthrew the great temple, and the imperial palace.
Amurath, being greatly discomfited by this dream, consulted his
wizard, who informed him, "that it was a warning sent by their
prophet Mahomet, who threatened the overthrow of their religion and
empire, unless Amurath engaged his whole force against the
Christians." This interpretation had so much influence with the
emperor, that he vowed not to lay down his arms until he had
utterly exterminated the Christians.</p>

<h3>TROUT FISHING.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I shall now sum up this <i>ticklish</i> subject, by
acquainting you with three more methods of catching trout in
Westmoreland.</p>
<p><i>Flood-netting</i>.&mdash;A flood net is a small net with a
semi-circular frame at the mouth of it, from which projects a long
handle. This is used only when there are floods; the fisher draws
it up the rivulets, and every now and then pulls it up to look for
his success. Sometimes he nets a great many at a time, and
especially if he wait the arrival of the flood, because a large
shoal mostly comes down with the first torrents.</p>
<p><i>Pod-netting</i>.&mdash;This derives its name from the
habitation of the trouts (the banks of the "becks") which are
called "hods" or "holds" and more frequently "pods," and this net
therefore goes by these three names. I have before described to you
the situation generally of these "<i>holds</i>" to be either in the
ledge of some rock or stone in the water, or under some bank
reaching over the stream. This net is used in fine weather, and
when the water is "<i>clear as crystal</i>;" the fisherman takes
hold of the handles of the net,<a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> and wades
through the stream as gently as possible, placing the net just at
the side of a trout's "hold," taking care to keep it as close to
the bottom as possible, to afford the trout no room for escape.
Then another with a long pole drives the trouts from the mouth of
the "<i>hold</i>," when they immediately dart into the net, and
nothing remains but to draw the net quickly up. This is a famous
method of fishing. I have been with parties when we have completely
cleared the beck. We went to "Carmony" in the spring of 1825, and
caught an immense quantity by fishing with the hand and pod. This
brings to my recollection an amusing circumstance, which I intend
troubling you with, though you may think it unworthy of notice. It
was reported in that year that there was a large quantity of trouts
in the beck; and I went at the recommendation of those who had seen
a particularly large one (when passing by) "basking" in the
streams. I was referred to a <i>certain</i> "<i>lum</i>," and
thither I went one afternoon with two friends, to try if we could
have an opportunity of seeing him. We had scarcely reached the spot
when we perceived him lying at the mouth of his "<i>hold</i>," a
fine grassy bank at the side of which grew a small bush; and I
employed my friends to watch the trout should he escape me. I
crossed the brook (my friends remaining on the opposite side),
pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and tucked up my shirt ready for
action. He was still lying very quietly, and as I knew I had no
chance with him then, I touched him gently with a twig and he moved
into his habitation. I then leaned over the bank, thrust in my arm,
touched his back, I felt his size, and was all caution. So first I
began to secure him by building a piece of wall before the bank to
prevent his going out; but I had no sooner laid the first stone
than out he bounced, and darted down the river about twenty yards,
(we running after him all the while) then up again, and so on for
about a quarter of an hour, till at length he became tired and
waddled into his dwelling. I now thought all secure, and once more
put in my hand, when he jumped at least three or four yards out of
the water. I must confess, I was a little confused with my friends'
dictation, who feared I should lose him. Again housed, I made a
kind of fort at one end of the hold, and this done, I again thrust
in my arm, when he was as soon out again, and on getting up I found
my hand covered with blood. Still he came back to his favourite
place, and I tried again, after giving my friends caution to be on
the look out. This time I was successful, I put my hand gently
under his belly, and by a tickle, secured the rascal, by thrusting
the fore-finger and thumb of my right hand in his gills. I got him
on to land, my friends ran about in exstacy, and I think I never
saw a finer trout than he proved to be&mdash;real Eden. We gave a
shout of triumph, after which we cut him on the nose to kill him.
From tail to snout he measured one foot four inches; but he was
beautifully plump and thick-made. We now began to wonder what
caused the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name=
"page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> blood on my hand, when on
examination, we found a large night hook in his side, which no
doubt I had touched, and had thus given him pain, and made him
restless. I will not prolong the story, but tell you he weighed
about two pounds and a half, and was acknowledged to be the
plumpest trout ever caught in that county by the hand.<a id=
"footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
"#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> Shortly afterwards I caught the
partner to it in the same place, but it was not so fine a trout,
and I had not so much effort in catching it. The largest trout ever
caught in this county weighed four pounds and a half, but that was
taken with the net. I have no other recommendation for this paper
but its originality. I have enjoyed the sport, and can only half
convey a description of it upon paper.</p>

<h3>OLD WINE.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>The passion for old wines has sometimes been carried to a very
ridiculous excess, for the "<i>thick crust</i>," the "<i>bee's
wing</i>," and the several other criterions of the epicure, are but
so many proofs of the decomposition and departure of some of the
best qualities of the wine. Had the man that first filled the
celebrated Heidleburg tun been placed as sentinel, to see that no
other wine was put into it, he would have found it much better at
twenty-five or thirty years old, than at one hundred, had he lived
so long, and been permitted now and then to taste it.</p>
<p>At Bremen there is a wine-cellar, called the Store, where five
hogsheads of Rhenish wine have been preserved since 1625. These
five hogsheads cost 1,200 francs. Had this sum been put out to
compound interest, each hogshead would now be worth above a
thousand millions of money, a bottle of this precious wine would
cost 21,799,480 francs, or about 908,311<i>l.</i>, and a single
wine-glass 2,723,808 francs, or about 113,492<i>l.</i>.</p>

<h3>THE HEROINE.</h3>
<h4>A SKETCH FROM SUNDRY NOVELS.</h4>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>She must be, <i>&agrave; plaisir</i>, tall and slender in
person, or of humbler stature, but never inclining to stoutness,
since the <i>en bon point</i> savours (at least in romance) of
vulgarity. Her complexion may be light or dark, according to fancy;
but her interesting pallidness may occasionally be relieved by a
hectic flush, yet more interesting. She must possess small
<i>alabaster</i> hands, <i>coral</i> or <i>ruby</i> lips, enchasing
a double row of <i>pearls</i>; a neck rivalling <i>ivory</i> or
driven <i>snow</i>, (yes, even if our heroine be a brunette, for
incongruity is the very essence of romance); <i>velvet</i> cheeks,
<i>golden</i> or <i>jet</i> black hair, <i>diamond</i> eyes,
marvellous delicate feet, shrouded at all times in
<i>bas-de-soie</i>, and defended by the most enchanting slippers
imaginable; her figure must be a model for the statuary, and at all
seasons, and in every situation, arrayed in muslins or silks,
which, wondrous to relate, resist the injuries of time, weather,
and wear in a manner perfectly astounding. What heroine had ever an
hiatus in her stocking, or a fracture in her gown of finest woof?
Ye gods! what an insult to suppose her <i>repairing such</i>! The
lady's mental accomplishments and qualifications are as
follow:&mdash;She sings divinely, plays on the harp (and piano too
in modern days) <i>&agrave; merveille</i>; occasionally condescends
to fascinate on the guitar, and the lute also, should that
instrument, now rather antiquated, fall in her way. She takes
portraits, and sketches from nature; she understands <i>all</i>
languages, or rather that desideratum, an <i>universal tongue</i>,
since in the most foreign lands she is never at a loss to render
herself understood, nor to comprehend that which is addressed to
her; she is of a melancholy cast of mind, and carries sal-volatile
in her reticule, and fountains of tears in her eyes, for use on the
most <i>public</i> occasions; she likes gloomy apartments, looking
upon the sea, mountains, or black forests, and leading into endless
corridors; she has an &AElig;olian lyre ever at her casement,
writes verses and weeps by moonlight, for&mdash;effect, or&mdash;
<i>nothing</i>; and is enamoured with a being, who, in the common
course of nature, could not exist; he possessing, amongst other
fine qualities, that of omnipresence in an impious degree. Should
the heroine reside in a town, and especially London, she must have
dwelt previously in some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168"
name="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> isolated mansion, seldom visited
by beings superior in intellect to the foxes they hunt; an idiot
mother, vulgar aunt, a father, an uncle, or a guardian in his
dotage, must have superintended her education; and when, at the age
of sixteen, some fortunate chance throws her into society, her
accomplishments and manners are found more fitting for it and
finished, than those of persons who have from their cradles
associated with families of the highest distinction, and possessed
all the advantages of a polished and liberal education. The heroine
has, in all situations, an abundant store of money, jewels, and
clothes, supplied no one knows when, how, or by whom; and these,
with her musical instruments, drawing materials, &amp;c. accompany
her into every reverse of situation, in a manner perfectly
incomprehensible, but highly amusing and edifying. A miniature
portrait of some mysterious relative or friend, seldom or ever
seen, nay, indeed, a sacred memento of the dead, is highly scenic
and effective in a romance. The heroine ought, by all means, to
possess such; it <i>may</i> do good, and it <i>can</i> do no harm.
Finally, the lady must frequently faint, be twice or thrice on the
brink of the grave, undergo exquisite varieties of suffering, run
all hazards, but retain her beauty and reputation unblemished to
the <i>last</i>, i.e. to her <i>marriage</i>; after which, this
wondrous and superlative creature, and her partner in perfection,
are never heard of more. <i>Why</i>?</p>

<h3>ANCIENT ROMAN FESTIVALS.</h3>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>The <i>Septmontium</i> was a festival of the seven mountains of
Rome, which was celebrated in this month, near the seven mountains,
within the walls of the city; they sacrificed seven times in seven
different places; and on that day the emperors were very liberal to
the people.</p>
<p>The <i>Meditrinalia</i> were feasts instituted in honour of the
goddess <i>Meditrina</i>, and celebrated on the 13th of September.
They were so called from <i>medendo</i>, because the Romans then
began to drink new wine, which they mixed with old, and <i>that</i>
served them instead of physic.</p>

<h2>NOTES OF A READER.</h2>
<h3>THE ANNUALS FOR 1829.</h3>
<p>These elegant little works are already in a forward state. MR.
ALARIC WATTS announces the plates of the SOUVENIR, "of a more
important size than heretofore," and twelve in number, already
completed. Among them are <i>Cleopatra embarking on the Cydnus</i>,
drawn by Danby, and engraved by Goodall; <i>Love taught by the
Graces</i>, drawn by Hilton, and engraved by J.C. Edwards; a
beautiful scene from <i>Lalla Rookh</i>, drawn by Stephanoff, and
engraved by Bacon; <i>She never told her Love</i>, drawn by
Westall, and engraved by Rolls. Whilst Mr. Watts has been catering
for the "children of a larger growth," Mrs. W. has been preparing a
"New Year's Gift; or <i>Juvenile</i> Souvenir", to be accompanied
with exquisite illustrations of Nursery literature; as the Children
in the Wood, Red Riding Hood, &amp;c. with two historical subjects
after Northcote.</p>
<p>Mr. Ackermann, to whom we are indebted for the
<i>naturalization</i> of "Annuals", announces that one of his
plates in the forthcoming "FORGET ME NOT"&mdash;(4 inches by 3 in
dimension) has cost one hundred guineas! The subject is "the Ruined
City," by Martin, engraved by Le Keux. Fine engraving is thus
almost as dear as building-ground at Brighton.</p>
<p>The KEEPSAKE will appear much earlier than last year. Sir Walter
Scott has written three or four articles, and two or three "noble
lords" are among the contributors. Nothing can exceed the beauty of
the specimens of the illustrations.</p>
<p>The FRIENDSHIP'S OFFERING passes into the editorial hands of Mr.
T. Pringle, of whose poetical talents we have lately had some
exquisite specimens.</p>
<p>The ANNIVERSARY.&mdash;Allan Cunningham has joined Mr. Sharp (of
whose taste in "getting up" books, our readers must be aware) in a
splendid volume to be called "The Anniversary." Among the
engravings are <i>Psyche</i>, after Sir Thomas Lawrence; <i>Young
Cottagers</i>, after Gainsborough; the <i>Author of Waverley in his
Study</i>, after W. Allen; a <i>Monkey</i>, &amp;c. by Landseer.
This is a new adventure, and we wish its projectors many
<i>anniversaries</i>.</p>
<p>The CHRISTMAS BOX is to contain "A Story," from the pen of Miss
Edgworth. Mrs. Hofland, Miss Mitford, and Mrs. Hemans, likewise,
contribute their pleasing aid.</p>
<p>The PLEDGE OF FRIENDSHIP is to be altered to <i>The Gem</i>, to
be edited by Mr. T. Hood, whose wit and fancy will sparkle among
the contributions; and who hopes that it may prove one of those
"hardy annuals," which are to become perennials; the writers are to
be of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>[pg
169]</span> "<i>authorized</i> popularity"&mdash;"the <i>plates</i>
not of the common <i>dessert</i> kind, but a welcome
<i>service</i>"&mdash;the engravers "as true as steel" to their
originals&mdash;and the whole equally "mental" and "ornamental:" so
the wight has begun already.</p>
<p>The WINTER'S WREATH promises to bloom more vigorously than ever,
and earlier too&mdash;in September. Among the contributors are the
names of Hemans, Opie, Mitford, Montgomery, Wiffen, Delta,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The AMULET is to be edited, as last year, by Mr. Hall.</p>
<p>The BIJOU is printing with <i>two-fold</i> energy.</p>
<p>We read the other day that Schiller's "History of the German
War," was originally published in <i>Damen Almanach</i>&mdash;a
Lady's Almanack! This is real <i>azure</i>. "Annuals" do not,
however, progress on the continent; for a new one, lately published
contained but a single original contribution. In America they have
bloomed with some success, though not with the elegance and polish
of our own country. Here their effect on the Fine Arts has been
very important, and they have done much for light reading, every
name of literary eminence, except those of Moore, Campbell, and
Rogers, having been enlisted in their ranks. We do not, however,
remember Leigh Hunt, although his pleasantries would relieve the
plaintiveness of some of the poetical contributions. A few
<i>Shandean</i> articles would be very agreeable&mdash;something
like the Housekeepers in the last "Friendships' Offering."</p>
<p>Nothing is said of the "Literary Pocket Book;" but our old
friend, "Time's Telescope," will be mounted as usual.</p>
<p>We also take this opportunity to state that the "ARCANA OF
SCIENCE AND ART, FOR 1829," will appear towards the close of the
present year; and, we are enabled to promise its patrons a still
greater modicum of novelty and interest than was even comprised in
its very successful forerunner.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MARTYRDOM.</h3>
<p>There is no truth more abundantly exemplified in the history of
mankind, than that the blood of martyrs, spilt in whatever cause,
political or religious, is the best imaginable seed for the growth
of favour towards their persons, and, as far as conversion depends
on feeling, of conversion to their opinions. "<i>Quoites mori emur
toties nasciemur</i>." &mdash;<i>Edin. Rev.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>ENGLISH LIBERTY.</h3>
<p>Our liberty is neither Greek nor Roman; but essentially English.
It has a character of its own,&mdash;a character which has taken a
tinge from the sentiments of the chivalrous ages, and which accords
with the peculiarities of our manners, and of our insular
situation. It has a language, too, of its own, and a language too
singularly idiomatic, full of meaning to ourselves, scarcely
intelligible to strangers. &mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>SENSUALITY.</h3>
<p>How different is the night of Nature from that of man, and the
repose of her scenes from the misrule of his sensual haunts; what a
contrast between the refreshing return of her morning, and the
feverish agonies of his day-dreams. &mdash;<i>Cameleon
Sketches.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>THE FLIMSY AGE.</h3>
<p>Poets sing of the "golden age," the "silver age," and the "iron
age," but were they to celebrate this, I think they should call it
the flimsy age, for every thing seems made to suit a temporary
purpose, without any regard to the sound and substantial. From
printed calico to printed books, from Kean's acting to Nash's
architecture, all is made to catch the eye, to gratify the appetite
for novelty, without regard to real and substantial excellence.
&mdash;<i>Blackwood</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>VILLAGE CHURCHES.</h3>
<p>We find very few monasteries founded after the twelfth century;
the great majority, which rose through the kingdom "like
exhalations," were founded between the eleventh and twelfth
centuries; and in all county histories and authentic records, we
scarce find a parish church, with the name of its resident rector
recorded, before the twelfth century. The first notice of any
village church occurs in the Saxon Chronicle, after the death of
the conqueror, A.D. 1087. They are called, there, "upland
churches." "Then the king did as his father bade him ere he was
dead; he then distributed treasures for his father's soul to each
monastery that was in England; to some ten marks of gold, to some
six; to each <i>upland</i> church sixty pence."&mdash;Ingram's
Saxon Chronicle. Gibson's note on the passage is, "unicuique
ecclesiae rurali." These rare rural churches, after the want of
them was felt, and after the lords of manors built, endowed, and
presented to them, spread so rapidly, that in 1200 in almost every
remote parish there was an "upland church," if not a resident
minister, as at this day.</p>
<p>The convents, however, still remained in their pristine
magnificence, though declining in purity of morals and in public
estimation. In place of new <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170"
name="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> foundations of this august
description, the&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Village parson's modest mansion rose,"</blockquote>
<p>gracefully shewing its unostentatious front, and, at length,
humbly adorning almost all the scattered villages of the
land.&mdash;<i>Bowles's History of Bremhill.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>It was pleasantly observed by a sentimental jockey, who lost by
a considerable length the first race he ever rode, "I'll never ride
another race as long as I live. The riders are the most selfish,
narrow minded creatures on the face of the earth. They kept riding
and galloping as fast as they could, and never had once the
kindness or civility to stop for me."&mdash;<i>Penelope</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>IRELAND.</h3>
<p>It has lately been proved by indisputable evidence, that the
present condition of the peasantry of Ireland is much superior, to
that of the population of the same island some centuries ago, when
the number of people did not exceed one million. Spenser describes
them as inhabiting "sties rather than houses, which is the chiefest
cause of the farmer's so beastly manner of living and savage
condition, lying and living together with his beast, in one house,
in one room, in one bed, that is clean straw, or rather a foul
dunghill."</p>
<p>In 1712, Dobbs, a man particularly conversant with the general
condition of Ireland, estimated that its population had increased
200,000. He states that "the common people are very poorly clothed,
go barelegged half the year, and very rarely taste of that flesh
meat with which we so much abound, but are pinched in every article
of life."</p>
<p>In 1762, Sir William Petty computed that the inhabitants of
Ireland amounted to about one million three hundred thousand. Their
habitations, he says, "are lamentable wretched cabins, such as
themselves could make in three or four days, not worth five
shillings the building, and filthy and disgusting to a degree,
which renders it necessary for us to refrain from quoting his
description. Out of the 200,000 houses of Ireland," says he,
"160,000 are wretched cabins, without chimney, window, or door
shut, even worse than those of the savages of America." Their food
at the same period, consisted "of cakes, whereof a penny serves for
each a week; potatoes from August till May; mussels, cockles, and
oysters, near the sea; eggs and butter made very rancid by keeping
in bogs; as for flesh they seldom eat it; they can content
themselves with potatoes."</p>
<hr />
<h3>SELF KNOWLEDGE.</h3>
<p>We often hear people call <i>themselves</i> fools. Now a man
ought to know whether he is a fool or not, and he would not say it
if he did not believe it; and there is also a degree of wisdom in
the discovery that one has been a fool, for thereby it is intimated
that the season of folly is over. Whosoever therefore actually says
that he was a fool formerly, virtually says that he is not a fool
now.&mdash;<i>Penelope</i>.</p>

<h3>CUNNING.</h3>
<p>In England, no class possesses so much of that peculiar ability
which is required for constructing ingenious schemes, and for
obviating remote difficulties, as the thieves and the thief-takers.
Women have more of this dexterity than men. Lawyers have more of it
than statesmen; statesmen have more of it than philosophers.</p>

<h3>STORY-TELLING.</h3>
<p>A friend of mine has one, and only one, good story, respecting a
gun, which he contrives to introduce upon all occasions, by the
following simple, but ingenious device. Whether the company in
which he is placed be numerous or select, addicted to strong
potations, or to long and surprising narratives; whatever may
happen to be the complexion of their character or conversation, let
but a convenient pause ensue, and my friend immediately hears, or
pretends to hear, the report of a gun. Every body listens, and
recalls his late impressions, upon which "the story of a gun" is
naturally, and as if by a casual association, introduced
thus&mdash;"By the by, speaking of guns, that puts me in mind of a
story about a gun;" and so the gun is fixed in regular style, and
the company condemned to smell powder for twenty minutes to come!
To the telling of this gun story, it is not, you see, at all
necessary that there should be an actual explosion and report; it
is sufficient that there <i>might</i> have been something of the
kind.</p>

Had to wait till a party got up&mdash;going off at six. Six

ruin best. Got up to Pagliano's a petrifaction! Worthy creature,

light. Coffee&mdash;<i>liqueur</i>&mdash;no wine for fear of
fever&mdash;went to bed quite thawed in body and mind; and walked
round Leicester-square next morning like "a giant
refreshed!"&mdash;<i>Blackwood</i>.</p>

<h3>DOMESDAY.</h3>
<p>Mr. Bowles in his <i>History of Bremhill</i>, makes a few
observations suggested by the account in <i>Domesday Book</i>, on
the wages, and some of the prices of agricultural produce on the
farms where the <i>villani</i> and <i>servi</i>, literally
<i>slaves</i> and <i>villans</i>, laboured. When we find two oxen
sold for seventeen shillings and four-pence, we must bear in mind
that one Norman shilling was as much in value as three of ours;
when we find that thirty hens were sold for three farthings each,
we must bear in mind the same proportion. The price of a sheep was
one shilling, that is three of ours. Wheat was six shillings
a-quarter; that would be, according to our scale, two shillings and
three-pence a-bushel. Now, at the time of this calculation,
everything must have borne a greater price, reckoning by money,
than at the time of Domesday; for the prices of articles now set
down (from an authentic document of the accounts of the Duke of
Cornwall, first published from the original by Sir R.C. Hoare, in

<h2>THE SKETCH BOOK.</h2>
<h3>STRIKING INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF A MIDSHIPMAN.</h3>
<p>I have read some theories, or rather hypotheses, of apparitions,
in which the authors attempt to account for the appearance of those
unsubstantial shadows, resembling the forms of living men, by
circumstances connected with the physical laws of matter. But I am
rather inclined to hold, with another class of inquirers, that the
origin of such marvels must be looked for in the mind of the seers;
although I do not go the length of their scepticism, and deny the
actual existence of the ghostly show, as a real and visible
spectacle, before the eyes.</p>
<p>These observations will derive some illustration at least, if
not entire confirmation, from the following narrative, which is
deemed to be authentic in the neighbourhood in which the scene is
laid; and the application of which the judicious reader will, no
doubt, be able to make for himself.</p>
<p>About the middle of the last war, the <i>Polly</i>, tender,
commanded by lieutenant Watts, came swooping up one evening to the
small town of Auchinbreck, in Scotland, and, resolving to pounce,
without warning, upon her prey, as soon as she had anchored in the
roads, sent ashore the press-gang to pick up as many of the stout
boat-builder lads as they could catch. The towns-people, however,
were not so unprepared as the captain of the tender imagined; some
of those, indeed, who were fit for sea, ran up into the hills, but
by far the greater number collected about the corner of a
building-shed as you go on to the main street, and, when the signal
of hostility was given, by the capture of a man by the press-gang,
they rushed down upon them in a body, every one with his axe on his
shoulder like a troop of Indians with their tomahawks. It had now
become so dark that the sailors had much to do to keep their
footing upon the loose stones of the beach, which was just at this
time rendered a still more troublesome passage by the scattered
materials of a pier, then beginning to be built; and, besides,
their number was so small compared to the townspeople, that, after
a few strokes of the cutlas, and as many oaths as would have got a
line-of-battle ship into action and out again, they were fain to
retreat to their boat, pursued by the boat-builders, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> young
and old, like furies. A midshipman, sitting in the stern, whose
name was William Morrison, a fine lad of fifteen, observed the fate
of the action with feelings in which local and professional spirit
struggled for the mastery. One moment he would rub his hands with
glee, and the next unsheath his dagger in anger, as he saw the axe
of a fellow-townsman descend on the half-guarded head of a brother
sailor; but, when the combatants came within oar's length of the
boat, and the retreat began to resemble a flight, the <i>esprit de
corps</i> got the upper hand in the Auchinbrecken midshipman's
feelings, and, unsheathing his dagger, he jumped nimbly ashore and
joined in the fray. At last the sailors got fairly into their boat
without a single man being either missing or killed, although the
list of the wounded included the whole party; and the landsmen,
apparently pretty much in the same circumstances, although unable,
from their number and the darkness, to reckon as instantaneously
the amount of the loss or damage, after giving three cheers of
triumph, retired in good order.</p>
<p>William Morrison, after discharging his duty so manfully, was
permitted to go on shore the same evening, to visit his friends;
and, indeed, the captain could not have known before that he
belonged to the place, as he surely would not have confided to the
lad so unpopular a task as that of kidnapping his own relations and
acquaintances. He was landed at the point of Scarlough, to prevent
the necessity of going through the streets, which might have been
dangerous in the excited state of the people's minds; and,
stretching across the fields, and along the side of the hill, he
steered steadily on in the direction of his paternal home, which
was about a mile and a half from the Point, but only one mile from
the town. The moon had now risen, but was only visible in short
glimpses through the clouds that were hurrying across the sky; and
the tall, strange shadows of the willows and yews that skirted the
churchyard, appearing and disappearing as he passed, probably by
recalling the associations of his earlier years, made William
shrink, and almost tremble. His own shadow, however, was a more
pleasing thing to look at. The dress, which, grown familiar by
usage, he would not have noticed elsewhere, was here brilliantly
contrasted in his recollection with the more clownish and common
garb of his boyhood&mdash;for he already reckoned himself a man;
and the dagger, projecting smartly from his belted side, gave, in
his opinion, a finish quite melodramatic to his air. He drew out
the tiny blade from its sheath, and its sparkle in the moonlight
seemed to be reflected in his eyes as he gazed on it from hilt to
point; but the expression of those eyes was changed as they
discovered that its polish in one place was dimmed by blood. This
could easily be accounted for by the affray on the beach&mdash;and
at any other time and place it would have been thought nothing
of;&mdash;but at this moment, and on this spot, he was as much
startled by the sight, as if his conscience had accused him of a
deliberate murder. The impressions his mind had received while
passing the churchyard, now returned upon him with added gloom; a
kind of misgiving came over him; and a thousand boding thoughts
haunted him like spirits, and hanging, as it were, on his heart,
dragged it down farther and farther at every step. He bitterly
regretted that he had not remained in the boat, as he had at first
resolved, a neutral spectator of the strife. How did he know that
his hand had not been raised against the life of his own brother?
As far as he could see or learn, indeed, no fatal accident had
occurred; but there have been instances of people walking cheerily
off the field of battle, and dying of their wounds after all. And
yet it was not likely&mdash;it was hardly possible&mdash;that John
could have been in the affray, his indentures protecting him from
the impress. These cogitations were speedily followed by others of
as gloomy a character; for the thoughts breed faster than we can
perceive them, and each multiplies after his kind. It was a year
since he had heard from his friends, and five years since he had
seen them. Who could tell what changes had taken place in that
time? Who could tell whether poor John had even lived to be killed
by the pressgang? His father, his mother, and his
sisters&mdash;were they dead, were they living, were they sick, or
in health? His sister had been always a delicate girl, one of those
gentle and fragile flowers of mortality that are sure not to live
till the summer; perhaps consumption, with the deceitful beauty of
his smile, had already led his fair partner down the short dance of
life.</p>
<p>Tormenting himself with such speculations, he arrived at his
father's house. Here he was surprised, bewildered, almost shocked,
to observe a new and handsome farm-house in place of the old one.
On looking farther on, however, he did detect the ancient
habitation of his family, in its original site; but it seemed, from
the distance where he stood, to be falling into ruins. His whole
race must either be dead or banished, and a new tribe of successors
settled in their place; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name=
"page173"></a>[pg 173]</span> or else uncle William must be
deceased, and have left his father money enough to build a new
house. He walked up to the door, where he stood trembling for some
minutes, without courage to put his hand to the latch, and at last
went round to the window, and, with a desperate effort, looked in.
How his heart bounded! His father was there, still a stout healthy
man of middle life, his hair hardly beginning to be grizzled, by
the meddling finger of the old painter Time; and his mother, as
handsome as ever, and her face relieved by the smile either of
habitual happiness, or of some momentary cause of joyful
excitation, from the Madonna cast which had distinguished it in
less prosperous days; and his sister, with only enough left of her
former delicacy of complexion to chasten the luxuriant freshness of
health on the ripe cheeks of nineteen. John, indeed, was not there;
but a vacant chair stood by the table ready to receive him, and
another&mdash;a second chair, beside it, only nearer the
fire&mdash;for whom?&mdash;for himself. His heart told him that it
was. Some one must have brought the tidings of his arrival; the
family circle were at that moment waiting to receive him; he could
see his old letters lying on the table before them, and recognised
the identical red splash he had dropped, as if accidentally, on the
corner of one&mdash;the dispatch he had written after his first
action&mdash;although he had taken the trouble to go to the
cock-pit to procure, for the occasion, this valorous token of
danger and glory. But John&mdash;it was so late for him to be from
home!&mdash;and, as a new idea passed across his mind, he turned
his eyes upon the old house, which was distant about a hundred
yards. It was probable, he thought, nay, more than probable, that
his father, when circumstances enabled him to build a new house for
himself, had given the old one to his eldest son; and John,
doubtless, was established there as the master of the family, and
perhaps at this moment was waiting anxiously for a message to
require his presence on the joyful occasion of his brother's
arrival. He did not calculate very curiously time or ages, for his
brother was only his senior by two years; he felt that he was
himself a man long ago, and thought that John by this time must be
almost an old man.</p>
<p>While these reflections were passing through his mind, he
observed a light in the window of the old house; but he could not
well tell whether it was merely the reflection of a moonbeam on the
glass, or a candle in the interior. He walked forward out of
curiosity; but the scene, as he approached the building, was so
gloomy, and the air so chill, that he wished to turn back; however,
he walked on till he reached the door, and there, sure enough, his
brother was waiting on the threshold to receive him. They shook
hands in silence, for William's heart was too full to speak, and he
followed John into the house; and an ill-cared-for house it was. He
stumbled among heaps of rubbish in the dark passage; and, as he
groped along the wall, his hand brought down patches of old lime,
and was caught in spiders' webs almost as strong as if the spinner
had meant to go a-fowling. When they had got into the parlour, he
saw that the building was indeed a ruin; there was not a whole pane
of glass in the window, nor a plank of wood in the damp floor; and
the fireplace, without fire, or grate to hold it, looked like the
entrance to a burying-vault. John, however, walked quietly in, and
sat down on a heap of rubbish by the ingleside; and William,
following his example, sat down over-against him. His heart now
began to quake, and he was afraid, without knowing what he had to
fear. He ran over in his mind the transactions of the
evening&mdash;his walk, his reflections, his
anxieties&mdash;embracing the whole, as if in one rapid and yet
detailed glance of the soul, and then turned his eyes upon his
brother both in fear and curiosity. What fearful secret could John
have to communicate in a place like this? Could he not have spoken
as well in the open air, where it was so much warmer, and in the
blessed light of the moon? No one was dead, or likely to die, that
he cared for; his dearest and almost only friends were at this
moment talking and laughing round their social table, and near a
bright fire, expecting his arrival, and John and he
were&mdash;here! At length, repressing by a strong effort the
undefined and undefinable feelings that were crowding upon him, he
broke the silence, which was now beginning to seem strange and
embarrassing.</p>
<p>"And how have you been, John?" said he, in the usual form of
friendly inquiries; "and how have you got on in the world since we
parted?"</p>
<p>"I have been well." replied John; "and I have got on as well as
mortal man could desire."</p>
<p>"Yet you cannot be happy; you must have something to
say&mdash;something I am almost afraid to hear. Out with it, in
God's name! and let us go home."</p>
<p>"Yes," said John, "I have something to say; but it will not take
long to hear, and then we shall both go home. I was apprenticed to
the boat-building four years ago."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>[pg
174]</span>
<p>"I know it," replied William; "you wrote to me about it
yourself, John."</p>
<p>"I was made foreman before my time was out."</p>
<p>"I know that, too," said William; "Fanny gave me the whole
particulars in a letter I received at Smyrna;&mdash;surely that
cannot be all."</p>
<p>"I have more to tell," said John, solemnly: "my apprenticeship
is out."</p>
<p>"What, in four years!&mdash;you are mad, John! What do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"The indenture was cancelled this evening."</p>
<p>"How?" cried William, with a gasp, and beginning to tremble all
over, without knowing why.</p>
<p>"I was wounded on the beach," said John, rising up, and walking
backwards towards the window; while the moon, entering into a dense
cloud, had scarcely sufficient power to exhibit the outlines of his
figure. "It was by the point of a dagger," continued he, his voice
sounding distant and indistinct, "<i>and I died of the
wound!</i>"</p>
<p>William was alone in the apartment, and he felt the hair rising
upon his head, and cold drops of sweat trickling down his brow. His
ghastly and bewildered look was hardly noticed by his parents and
sister during the first moments of salutation; and, when it was,
the excuse was illness and fatigue. He could neither eat nor drink,
(it seemed as if he had lost altogether the faculty of swallowing,)
but sat silent and stupified, turning his head ever and anon to the
door, till it struck one o'clock. About this time a knocking was
heard, and the sister, jumping up, cried it was John come home, and
ran to open the door. But it was not John; it was the minister of
the parish; and he had scarcely time to break the blow to the
parents with the shield of religion, when the dead body of their
eldest son was brought into the house.&mdash;<i>Orient.

<p><i>Zoological Gardens.</i></p>
<p>It is stated that upwards of one hundred and eighty pounds have
been received for the admission of the public to these gardens
during one week.</p>
<p>We omitted to mention last week, that one of the lamas was
presented by Robert Barclay, Esq. of Bury Hill; a leopard by Lord
Auckland; several animals from the Arctic regions by the Hudson's
Bay Company, &amp;c. The pair of emus were bred at Windsor, by Lord
Mountcharles. The emu is hunted in New South Wales for its oil; it
frequently weighs 100 lbs., and its taste, when cooked, more
resembles beef than fowl.&mdash;See <i>Notes</i>, p. 378, vol. xi.
MIRROR.</p>
<p><i>Venerable Orange Tree.</i></p>
<p>There is an orange tree, still living and vigorous, in the
orangery at Versailles, which is well ascertained to be above 400
years old. It is designated the Bourbon, having belonged to the
celebrated constable of that name in the beginning of the 16th
century, and been confiscated to the crown in 1522, at which time
it was 100 years old. A crown is placed on the box in which it is
planted, with this inscription, "Sown in 1421."</p>
<p>Thirty-four orange-trees have lately been received at Windsor,
as a present from the king of France to George IV.</p>
<p><i>Potato Mortar.</i></p>
<p>M. Cadet-de-Vaux found mortar of lime and sand, and also that
made from clay, greatly improved in durability by mixing boiled
potatoes with it.</p>
<p><i>An Experimental Farm,</i></p>
<p>As a school of practical husbandry for a part of central France,
has been formed by the celebrated Abb&eacute; de Pradt. It is
situated about a league from Avranches, on the great road from that
city to Bort, in the department of Corr&egrave;ze.&mdash;<i>Foreign
Q. Rev.</i></p>
<p><i>A Tunnel under the Vistula, at Warsaw,</i></p>
<p>Has been projected. This mode of communication will be of the
utmost utility, especially at the times of the breaking up of the
frost, when all intercourse is interrupted. The architect is a
foreigner, and has engaged to complete the work in the space of
three years.&mdash;<i>Paris Paper.</i></p>
<p><i>Small White Slugs,</i></p>
<p>In gardens, are more injurious than the larger variety, because
their diminutive size escapes the gardener's eye. A good way to
keep them under is to make small holes, about an inch deep, and
about the diameter of the little finger, round the plants which
they infest. Into these holes the slugs will retreat during the
day, and they may be killed there by dropping in a little salt,
quicklime in powder, or by strong lime and
water.&mdash;<i>Gardener's Mag.</i></p>
<p><i>Turkish Method of Preserving Filberts.</i></p>
<p>When perfectly ripe, remove the husks, and dry the nuts, by
rubbing with a coarse cloth; sprinkle the bottom of a stone jar
with a very little salt; then place a layer of filberts, adding a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>[pg
175]</span> small quantity of salt between each layer. The jar must
be perfectly dry and clean. Secure the top from air, and keep them
in a dry place; and, at the end of six months, they will
peel.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
<p><i>Extinction of Fires.</i></p>
<p>When a chimney or flue is on fire, throw into the fire-place one
handful after another of flower of sulphur. This, by its
combustion, effects the decomposition of the atmospheric air, which
is, in consequence, paralysed, or, in effect, annihilated.</p>
<p><i>Oysters.</i></p>
<p>After the month of May, it is felony to carry away the caltch
(the spawn adhering to stones, old oyster-shells, &amp;c.) and
punishable to take any oysters, except those of the size of a
half-crown piece, or such as, when the two shells are shut, will
admit of a shilling rattling between them.</p>
<p>The liquor of the oyster contains incredible multitudes of small
embryo oysters, covered with little shells, perfectly transparent,
swimming nimbly about. One hundred and twenty of these in a row
would extend one inch. Besides these young oysters, the liquor
contains a great variety of animalcules, five hundred times less in
size, which emit a phosphoric light. The list of inhabitants,
however, does not conclude here, for besides these last mentioned,
there are three distinct species of worms (called the oyster-worm,)
half an inch long, found in oysters, which shine in the dark like
glow-worms. The sea-star, cockles, and muscles, are the great
enemies of the oyster. The first gets within the shell when they
gape, and sucks them out.</p>
<p>While the tide is flowing, oysters lie with the hollow side
downwards, but when it ebbs they turn on the other side. <a id=

<p><i>Swarming of Bees.</i></p>
<p>An interesting communication was read, at a recent sitting of
the Royal Society, from T.A. Knight, Esq. describing the precaution
taken by a swarm of bees, in reconnoitering the situation where
they intend to establish their new colony, or swarm from the parent
hive. The bees do not go out in a considerable body, but they
succeed each other in going and returning, until the whole of the
swarm have apparently made good the survey, after which the whole
body take their departure in a mass. If by any chance a large
portion of a swarm take their departure without the queen bee, they
never proceed to take up the ulterior quarters without her
majesty's presence. The result of Mr. Knight's observations tends
to prove, that all the operations of a swarm of bees are dictated
by previous concert, and the most systematic arrangement.</p>

<h3>ACCOMMODATION FOR THREE HALFPENCE.</h3>
<p>A gentleman on a wet evening entered the bar of an inn, and
while standing before the fire, called to a servant girl who had
come to receive his orders, "Margaret, bring me a glass of ale, a
clean pipe, a spitoon, a pair of snuffers, and the newspaper. And
Margaret, take away my great coat, carry it into the kitchen, and
hang it before the fire to dry, and dry my umbrella, and tell me
what o'clock it is; and if Mr. Huggins should come in, request him
to come this way, for I think 'tis near seven, and he promised to
meet me at that hour. And Margaret, get me change for a sovereign,
and see that all the change is good, take for the glass of ale out
of it, and put the coppers in a piece of paper. And Margaret, tell
Jemima to bring some more coals, take away the ashes, and wipe the
table. And Margaret, pull down the blinds, shut the door, and
put-to the window-shutters."&mdash;N.B. The gentleman had his own
tobacco.</p>

<h3>A GENTLEMAN.</h3>
<p>To tell the reader exactly what class of persons was meant to be
designated by the word <i>gentleman</i>, is a difficult task. The
last time we heard it, was on visiting a stable to look at a horse,
when, inquiring for the coachman, his stable-keeper replied, "He
has just stepped to the public-house along with another
gentleman."</p>
<p>The following is the negro's definition of a
<i>gentleman</i>:&mdash;"<i>Massa make de black man
workee&mdash;make de horse workee&mdash;make de ox
workee&mdash;make every ting workee, only de hog: he, de hog, no
workee; he eat, he drink, he walk about, he go to sleep when he
please, he liff like a GENTLEMAN</i>."</p>
<hr />
<h3>"VERY BAD."</h3>
<p>Why are washer-women, busily engaged, like Adam and Eve in
Paradise? Because they are <i>so-apy</i> (so happy).</p>
<p>Why is a widower, going to be married, like Eau de Cologne?
Because he is <i>re-wiving</i>.</p>
<p>Why is a vine like a soldier? Because it is listed and trained,
has <i>ten-drills</i>, and shoots.</p>
<p>Why is a sailor, when at sea, not a sailor? Because he's
<i>a-board</i>.</p>
<p>Why is a city gentleman, taken poorly in Grosvenor-square, like
a recluse? Because he is <i>sick-westward</i> (sequestered.)</p>
<p>Why is it better for a man to have two losses than one? Because
the first is a loss, and the second is <i>a-gain</i>.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
